## 🏆 Hackathon Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Currently, municipal and service call centers depend on human operators to receive complaints. This creates several issues:

- Limited number of staff  
- Slow complaint registration  
- Human errors  
- Behavioral and communication issues  
- High call volume during peak hours  

### Proposed Solution
We propose an **AI-based call receiving system** that:
- Automatically attends incoming calls  
- Communicates with users in Gujarati, Hindi, and English  
- Asks relevant follow-up questions  
- Extracts complaint information  
- Registers complaints in the system database  
- Reduces human workload

## 🚀 Features

- Voice-based complaint registration  
- Multilingual speech recognition  
- AI-based complaint classification  
- Automatic extraction of:
  - Address  
  - Ward  
  - Zone  
- SQLite database storage  
- Admin panel for monitoring complaints  
- FastAPI backend server  
- Status dashboard
